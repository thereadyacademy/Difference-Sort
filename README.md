This will present you with a menu to choose between the standard demo and research paper formats

### Input Methods

1. **Manual Input**
   - Enter integers separated by commas or spaces
   - Example: `5, 2, 8, 1, 9` or `5 2 8 1 9`

2. **Random Generation**
   - Use sliders to set array size (5-50 elements)
   - Set maximum value range (10-1000)
   - Click "Generate Random Array"

3. **Predefined Test Cases**
   - Small Array: `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`
   - Already Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Reverse Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - With Duplicates: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`
   - Large Range: `[100, 5, 200, 15, 50]`
   - Single Element: `[42]`
   - Two Elements: `[3, 1]`


### Performance Testing
- Click "Run Performance Tests" to benchmark algorithms with arrays up to 10M elements
- Click "Test Space Efficiency" to analyze memory usage with sparse data

## Algorithm Explanation

### Original Reference-Based Sorting

The algorithm works in four main steps:

1. **Reference Selection**: The first element becomes the reference point
2. **Difference Calculation**: Calculate the difference of each element relative to the reference
3. **Positioning**: Place elements in positions based on their differences
4. **Null Removal**: Remove null values to get the final sorted array

#### Example Walkthrough
For array `[5, 2, 8, 1, 9]`:
- **Reference**: 5
- **Differences**: [0, -3, 3, -4, 4]
- **Min difference**: -4, Max difference: 4
- **Position mapping**: 
  - 1 (diff=-4) â†’ position 0
  - 2 (diff=-3) â†’ position 1
  - 5 (diff=0) â†’ position 4
  - 8 (diff=3) â†’ position 7
  - 9 (diff=4) â†’ position 8
- **Positioned array**: [1, 2, null, null, 5, null, null, 8, 9]
- **Final sorted**: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]


## Architecture

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity
| Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Reference-Based | O(n) | O(n + k) | O(n + k) | O(k) |
| Built-in Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| Bubble Sort | O(n) | O(nÂ²) | O(nÂ²) | O(1) |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(nÂ²) | O(log n) |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) |

*Note: k = range of input values (max - min + 1), n = number of elements*

### Space Efficiency

The reference-based algorithm's space complexity depends on the range of values:
- Dense data (k â‰ˆ n): Efficient space usage
- Sparse data (k >> n): High memory usage due to null positions
- Example: Array [1, 1000] requires 1000 positions despite having only 2 elements

## Examples

### Basic Usage Example
```python
# Input array
arr = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]

# Reference-based algorithm result
# Step 1: Reference = 5
# Step 2: Differences = [0, -3, 3, -4, 4]
# Step 3: Positioned = [1, 2, null, null, 5, null, null, 8, 9]
# Step 4: Sorted = [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty arrays: Returns empty array
- Single element: Returns unchanged
- Duplicates: Maintains relative order
- Negative numbers: Handles correctly
- Mixed positive/negative: Sorts properly
